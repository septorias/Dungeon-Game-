Dungeon Game Backstory
Welcome to the locked dungeon, where lives are lost on a daily basis (hehe). Few make it through. Will you be one of them…?
How to get out you ask?? Oh you didn't... Well that’s awkward... Well I'm going to tell you anyway. You have three rooms to get through. Each room will be different. The walls may close in, the floor may drop from under you. Who knows, you may be perfectly fine.


You get the chance to find items in each room… What items you ask, well I'm not telling… you were very rude earlier.


Ok you twisted my arm.. Health is one of them… maybe more, maybe not. Could find a dead body, could find a secret room. Object of the game. Find the key to get out. Only have to go through 2 rooms to get there. 
Sounds simple, right? Well each room has three questions, you get two chances. Answer wrong , lose health and try again. All 3 must be correct to move on. Fail twice GAME OVER…. 


Once you reach the third room ….CONGRATULATIONS… you have reached the end only if you find the key that is. Well thats it…..Goood Luuck …(well the dragon’s got more dinner tonight…..)
